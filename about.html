        <p>Hello people of the internet, welcome to the website my hooman made me. My name is Paco Taco Escobar, but you
            can just call me Paco.
            I'm a fawn colored pug and I turned 3 years old in Februrary (21 if we're talking dog years). I live with my
            mom and dad (they're my hoomans), my hooman brother Landon, and my kitty brother Zeke.
            My favorite activites are eating, sleeping, and cuddling with mom. My hoomans say I've gained quite a bit of
            weight during quarantine but I think they're just trying to starve me.
            I love my hoomans and kitty brother.</p>
